( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\\ndear shareholder , addlrko\\ni am writing to you today to\\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\\nlast week we announced that abdv\\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\\nyou may ask ; why the energy\\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\\nso what do we do with our\\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\\nby concentrating on a specific\\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\\nfine wein records , inc .\\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\\ncorporation , inc .
